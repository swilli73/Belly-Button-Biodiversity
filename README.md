# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
Javascript, Visual Studio Code, Plotly, HTML

### The customizations I added to the base starter code for this project was a background for the non-element portions of the page, adding a project overview, and adjusting the layout of the elements a bit by editing their "col-md" classes. I also slightly changed the font of the jumbotron and well elements.
